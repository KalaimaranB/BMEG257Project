/**
 * Arduino Temperature Monitoring System
 * 
 * This script reads temperature from an analog sensor connected to A0,
 * compares it against a safe range, and alerts the user if it goes out of range.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Reads temperature from an analog input.
 * - Converts sensor voltage to temperature using a predefined formula.
 * - Uses the built-in LED (LED_BUILTIN) to indicate warnings when temperature is out of range.
 * - Continuously checks temperature every second.
 * - Sends temperature readings and warnings via Serial Monitor.
 * 
 * Hardware:
 * - Temperature sensor connected to A0 (analog input).
 * - Built-in LED blinks when temperature is out of range.
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - Uses "HelperFunctions.h" for sensor initialization and warning messages.
